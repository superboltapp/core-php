**Note:** Replace ```Superbolt``` ```superboltapp``` ```https://github.com/superboltapp``` ```package@superbolt.app``` ```superbolt``` ```core-php``` ```PHP package for Superbolt``` with their correct values in [README.md](readme.md), [CHANGELOG.md](changelog.md), [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), [LICENSE.md](license.md) and [composer.json](composer.json) files, then delete this line. You can run `$ php prefill.php` in the command line to make all replacements at once. Delete the file prefill.php as well.

This is where your description should go. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two, and maybe throw in a mention of what
PSRs you support to avoid any confusion with users and contributors.
